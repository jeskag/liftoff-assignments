## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my Capstone Project, I've decided to construct a web app that shows a list of adoptable pets for a given shelter.  The shelter
will be able to upload photos of animals available for adoption as well as be able to modify or delete animals that have been
adopted.  In addition to being able to show adoptable animals, the app will allow the adopter to submit an online application.
Within that application, there will be a field where they will upload their photo.  From the information on the app and photo, it 
will bump up against a database for people who have been convicted of animal abuse or running puppy mills.  If no match is found,
the adopter will be able to set up a time to meet the animal they are interested in.  If there is a match, the adopter will not 
be immediately excluded, however, they will receive a note their app is under consideration and a member of the rescue will contact
them about their application.  With all of this, a database is being created and updated based on the responses of the web app.

I have a huge passion for animals so I wanted to develop something that would be something positive that would end up helping animals
in the long run.  When I've adopted my animals, many rescues have a lot of paperwork and no way to track if someone is a good 
adopter.  I am hoping this app will help weed out any bad adopters and only place animals in loving homes.

### Features
Some of the features I hope to include, but not limited to:
     - Login page for the rescue
	 - Once the rescue logs in, to be able to upload/modify/delete photos of animals as well as publish a bio.
	 - The ability for the adopter to upload a photo of themselves.
	 - The adopters application to display questions relevant to them.  If they answer one way, additional questions may pop up.
	 - The adopters will be able to search for a particular animal based on what they are looking for (i.e. age, sex, breed, etc)

### Technologies
Some of the technologies I hope to include:
     - C#
	 - SQLAlchemy
	 - Jinja2

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm sure there are a lot of things that will be new to me, but some that I can think of:
     - Being able to upload a photo
	 - Linking a photo/data to an "animal offenders database"
	 - Making an appointment online with the rescue (displaying the rescue's calendar)
